Insurance web App.
- In this App I am using vue js framework for the app development.
- Used local storage for form data storage- As we are not using any api at
this point I chose to use local storage.

Given the scope of the project I chose to use a layered architecture as there are few business needs.
If there was need to expand this project micro service architecture would be most suitable, that each component is turned into an indipendent service.
where we have a form input with the name and details we 
would use an authetication service to handle this.

-I used a top-down approach, I first did a system breakdown, drew usercases then implemented the system.
